    <p>
        I've thought of a word. My word has four letters. Your task is to guess my word. Every time you make a guess I'll tell you how many of the letters in your word are <b>R</b>ight, but in the <b>W</b>rong place in the first column, and how many are <b>R</b>ight and in the <b>R</b>ight place in the second column.
    </p>
    <P>
        Good luck!
    </P>
        Guess the word: <input type="text" id="guess" maxlength="4" onchange="play()" autofocus>
        <button onclick="play()">Guess!</button>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>R, W</th>
                <th>R, R</th>
                <th>Guess</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody id="list">
            
        </tbody>
    </table>
